For this assignment you need to work on following data sets:
 
1million news headlines from ABC News
Sentiment Lexicon - the list of Positive/Negative words from SentiWordNet and http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html. 
 
You need to write properly commented Pig Latin scripts to perform sentimental analysis on the news headline, classifying them as positive, negative or neutral. You are not supposed to use any UDFs other than the ones provided with standard Pig installation.  For the Sentimental analysis you will compare words in the headline for presence in Sentiment Lexicon i.e files with positive and negative words (positive.txt, negative.txt and positivenegative.txt)

The output should be written to a file in the following format: Headline | PositiveCount | NegativeCount | Classification

Best of luck!!
